My iOS app
<br>
I decided to build a budgeting app called “Budget Cuts”. When the app launches, a launch screen with the name of the app and an icon are displayed. The launch screen then takes you to a table view controller where a user can insert specific budgets via an alert text field. The user specifies the amount of money they would like to budget for a specific expenditure. As the user spends money on each type of expenditure, they can subtract what they spend from their budget. The new total is then updated. In addition to these features, a user can analyze the current budget that they have set for themselves. By this I mean that the app segues to another table view where the percentage of each type of budget is displayed. The user can add and delete budgets as they need.
